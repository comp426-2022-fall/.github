# Modern Web Programming (COMP 426)

In this course, we will take a very practical, hands-on approach to learning how to design, build, and interact with web APIs, back-end server applications, and front-end client apps and interfaces. 

We will also focus on learning some "soft skills" that often go by the wayside, including collaborative development workflows, project management, reading and understanding errors, reading and writing documentation, and maintaining healthy work practices.

We will discuss licensing and make use of and operate entirely within open source ecosystems.
