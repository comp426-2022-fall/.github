If you wish to have some aspect of how the autograder actions for the final exam works explained in greater detail please put a link to the section in this document here: https://github.com/comp426-2022-fall/assignments/blob/main/e02comp-autograder.md

Include the following in your issues

- [ ] Your question.
- [ ] A link to the specific action check that you are asking about (see above for documentation). 

If you (really, really) believe that there is something misfiring in the autograder action and that your code should be passing based on the specification given in the exam `README.md`, then do the following

- [ ] Provide a link to the last action run that failed.
- [ ] Explain what you think should be happening.
- [ ] Provide **_screenshots_** of your test run on _your local_ machine.
- [ ] Explain why you think the autograder is failing, with specific details about how the autograder action works in relation to your code. If your explanation is, "It just is and I don't know why," then STOP and think through this. That issue will be closed without consideration.
